# Memo - a future-proof Personal Notes Manager

This is "readme" for Kris' Go version of the future-proof Notes app. 

Written in Go, as an example. 

A multi-phase educational project for managing personal notes with structured metadata.

In my Go veresion, I've created a `mermaid` document with diagrams. https://github.com/kristofer/memo/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md
