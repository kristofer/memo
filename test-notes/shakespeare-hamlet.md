# Writers' Council - The Danish Tragedy
## The Globe, London - 12th June, 1587

## Present Quills
- Master William Shakespeare (Chief Wordsmith)
- Thomas Kyd (Revenge Expert)
- Christopher Marlowe (Dramatic Tension Consultant)
- Francis Beaumont (Character Development)
- John Fletcher (Dialogue Specialist)

## Primary Considerations for Our Danish Tale

### Master Shakespeare's Opening Thoughts
Gentlemen, I thank thee for attending on such short notice. I've been visited three nights hence by a most peculiar dream of a Danish prince and his ghostly father. Methinks there's a play worth penning here! The Danes have a history most bloody and suitable for our stage.

### Master Kyd's Contributions
- Structure similar to Spanish Tragedy might serve well
- A revenge delayed makes for tension most exquisite
- Perhaps our Prince might feign madness to disguise his true intent?
- The ghost must demand vengeance, as all proper ghosts do

### Master Marlowe's Suggestions
- This Prince needs an exceptional mind - perhaps too much thinking is his flaw?
- A soliloquy questioning existence itself would not go amiss
- Death should stalk the stage, appearing in many forms
- Might we include a play-within-our-play? Most meta, most modern!

### Master Beaumont on Characters
- Our Prince: Melancholic, scholarly, indecisive yet passionate
- The Queen: Complicit or ignorant? Let's keep it ambiguous
- The King: Recently crowned, outwardly noble but inwardly corrupt
- A maiden driven to madness by grief - flowers and drowning make for poetic demise
- Perhaps a faithful friend who dies for his loyalty?

### Master Fletcher on Dialogue
- Prince must speak both plainly and in riddles - showing his descent
- Common folk should provide humor midst the tragedy
- Gravediggers discussing mortality while at their trade?
- Need memorable phrase - "To be or not to be?" has a certain ring

## Plot Mechanisms to Consider

1. **The Ghost Visitation**
   - Appears only to select characters
   - Speaks of murder most foul
   - Vanishes before questions fully answered

2. **The Mock Play**
   - Recreates the murder to observe the King's reaction
   - Players within players - life mirroring art mirroring life

3. **The Duel**
   - Final confrontation needs spectacle
   - Poisoned sword? Poisoned wine? Both mayhaps?
   - All principal characters should perish dramatically

4. **The Political Backdrop**
   - Norway threatens from beyond our stage
   - Perhaps a noble warrior enters at tale's end to restore order?

## Concerns to Address

- Too many deaths might strain credulity
- Skull props needed - speak to gravedigger Thom about procurement
- Danish pronunciation - shall we attempt accents or nay?
- Master Burbage will demand the Prince's role - tailor character to his strengths

## Refreshments Consumed
- 3 flagons of ale (Marlowe consumed 2)
- 1 wheel of cheese
- Various meat pies of questionable origin
- Oranges from the Spanish merchant (quite tart!)

## Next Council
- Meet fortnight hence with draft speeches for our Prince
- Shakespeare to sketch five acts with principal scenes
- All to consider: What if the Prince were indeed mad and not feigning?
